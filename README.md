## Introduction
Binary trees are a fundamental data structure in computer science. This project covers various operations on binary trees, including insertion, deletion, traversal, and more.

## Requirements
- GCC compiler
- Make

## Installation
Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your_username/holbertonschool-binary_trees.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```sh
cd holbertonschool-binary_trees
```

## Usage
Compile the code using Make:
```sh
make
```
Run the tests:
```sh
./binary_trees
```

## Files
- `binary_trees.h`: Header file containing all function prototypes and data structures.
- `binary_tree_print.c`: Function to print binary trees.
- `binary_tree_insert.c`: Functions to insert nodes into binary trees.
- `binary_tree_delete.c`: Functions to delete nodes from binary trees.
