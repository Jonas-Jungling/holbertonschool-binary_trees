## Introduction
A binary tree is a data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. This project covers various operations on binary trees, including insertion, deletion, traversal, and more.

## Requirements
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- GCC 9.3.0

## Files
- `binary_trees.h`: Header file containing all function prototypes and data structures.
- `binary_tree_print.c`: Function to print binary trees.
- `binary_tree_create.c`: Functions to create binary trees.
- `binary_tree_insert.c`: Functions to insert nodes into binary trees.
- `binary_tree_delete.c`: Functions to delete nodes from binary trees.
- `binary_tree_traversal.c`: Functions to traverse binary trees.
- `binary_tree_height.c`: Functions to measure the height of binary trees.
- `binary_tree_depth.c`: Functions to measure the depth of nodes in binary trees.
- `binary_tree_size.c`: Functions to measure the size of binary trees.
- `binary_tree_leaves.c`: Functions to count the leaves in binary trees.
- `binary_tree_nodes.c`: Functions to count the nodes with at least one child in binary trees.
- `binary_tree_balance.c`: Functions to measure the balance factor of binary trees.
- `binary_tree_is_full.c`: Functions to check if binary trees are full.
- `binary_tree_is_perfect.c`: Functions to check if binary trees are perfect.
- `binary_tree_sibling.c`: Functions to find the sibling of a node in binary trees.
- `binary_tree_uncle.c`: Functions to find the uncle of a node in binary trees.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/your_username/holbertonschool-binary_trees.git
  ```
2. Compile the files:
  ```sh
  gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic *.c -o binary_trees
  ```
3. Run the executable:
  ```sh
  ./binary_trees
  ```
